This package contains the implementation of the bucket-pointer refinement algorithm version 2.0.0 (bpr2)
to construct suffix arrays ('./src/SuffixArray/kbs_SuffixArrayConstDStepAndPre.c' resp.
'./src/SuffixArray/kbs_SuffixArrayConstDStepAndPreNumbers.c').

This is a faster enhanced implementation of the algorithm described in the paper:
Klaus-Bernd Schürmann and Jens Stoye
An Incomplex Algorithm for Fast Suffix Array Construction
'Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments
and the 2nd Workshop on Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics ({ALENEX}/{ANALCO} 2005)'.
The current algorithm is presented in my PhD thesis.


The programs of this package are
	1. bprtime     - timing for the bpr algorithm
	2. fibstring   - generation of fibonacci string of certain length
	3. periodicstr - generation of periodic string with certain alphabet size, period length, and string length


To install the programs execute
	./bootstrap.sh
	./configure CC=<compiler-command> CFLAGS="<compiler-options>" bindir=<directory-to-install-binaries>
	make
	make install

The default options for ./configure are CC=gcc, CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -fprefetch-loop-arrays -W -Winline -Wall", 
and the default bindir of the system.

The program is executed by: bprtime -q=<size of prefixes to which respect the suffixes are initially sorted> <File of Input String>,
where the -q Option can be omitted.


To see more documentation of the source code, execute
	doxygen doxyBpr.cfg
The documentation of the source code will be located in the directory ./docs

For more details on how to deal with automake read the file 'INSTALL'

The software in this archive should be considered an ALPHA version. I will be
glad to receive your comments and bug reports.
